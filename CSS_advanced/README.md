Starting with CSS to recreate Figma file

1: This project is following the HTML, advanced project - please make sure all tasks of this previous one are fully done.

For this project, you will focus on the CSS and the style of the page.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

Page in Figma
fig file
And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details. (if not already done)

2: Based on the Figma file, add the correct styling to the header and first section of the page:
Reminders:

- All colors values, width, height and images are part of the Figma
- Keep your CSS simple and clean - use as simple as you can CSS selectors
- Be accurate - the final result should be the same as the page at the end!
